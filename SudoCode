some very sudo code (not really just more of what I want the program to do vaguely)

it will have 2 main functions: input ticket amounts and print cards, input team scores and week number then output winners for the week (and a terminal with commands)
-----------------------------------
input ticket amounts and print cards:

+ input the amount of players 
+ generate every combinations/week for all 17 weeks
- for every card, create a text file (for now) and send to printer

-----------------------------------
output winners for the week:
- enter all the scores for the week
  + I already have this done as a randomizer but is very easy to change to per-team manual score input.
- enter a week
+ proccess it and return the winners for that week
- make it be able to do ties
